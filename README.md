Here are the **key features** of your provided Java GUI pathfinding code:

---

# 🚀 Key Features of PathfinderGUI

### ✅ **1. Graph-Based Pathfinding System**

* The system models different areas as nodes and roads as edges in a graph.
* Supports **multiple routes** from a selected starting point to the destination (BRAC).

---

### 🎯 **2. User-Friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

* Built using **Java Swing** for a simple, interactive interface.
* Allows users to:

  * Select a **starting area** via radio buttons.
  * Choose **transport preference** (Rikshaw or Bus) from a dropdown.
  * View all possible paths to BRAC displayed in a scrollable text area.

---

### 🚏 **3. Multiple Transport Cost Handling**

* Each road supports **two different transportation costs:**

  * Rikshaw cost
  * Bus cost
* Dynamically adjusts the path cost calculation based on **user’s transport preference**.

---

### 🔍 **4. Full Path Display with Cost Calculation**

* Shows:

  * The **sequence of areas** in each path.
  * The **transport type and cost** between each segment.
  * The **total transport cost** for each path.

---

### 🔁 **5. Depth-First Search (DFS) for Pathfinding**

* Implements a **DFS algorithm** to:

  * Explore all possible paths from the start to the destination.
  * Display all valid paths (not just the shortest).

---

### 📜 **6. Real-Time Path Calculation**

* Paths are computed and displayed **instantly** when the user clicks the "Compute Paths" button.
* No need for manual data refresh or page reload.

---

### 🗺️ **7. Customizable Road Network**

* The road matrix can be easily modified to add or remove connections or areas.
* The system is **scalable** to more complex road maps.

---

### 💡 **Potential Improvements (if you want to add later)**

* Visual map representation.
* Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path.
* Real-time transport availability.
* Estimated travel time based on transport mode.
* Enhanced UI with color-coded paths.
